# React + Vite
<h1>Third version of the website for the design-studio "Metrica". 
  <br />
  Was implemented using the React library + Vite assembler.</h1>
<br />
    <p>The first (detailed) version written in pure HTML + Css can be found at this link - https://github.com/kirafoxy/DS-Metrika </p>
 <br />   
    <p>The second option (part of the original) using adaptive layout and using a JavaScript and media query - https://github.com/kirafoxy/DS-Metrika-adaptive </p>

    <ul>Technology stack
      <li>React</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>Css</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The component-based approach to writing websites using the React library is great for quickly and structured writing one-page websites and applications.</p>

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
